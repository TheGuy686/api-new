### Pros and Cons
| Pros | Cons |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Getting Started Quickly - Very rapid prototyping and quick application development  |  Higher Learning Curve - lots of time spent on learning the platform rather than coading |
| Fast Development Cycles |  Collaboration is difficult - Larger team find difficulty while developing application together |
| Shielding From the Complexity of AWS - It configure most of required aws services automatically | To much background services - Amplify have lage client side libraries which results in lots of extra lines of code |
| Free to Start - initially most of the amplify services are under the free tire of aws | As it is a managed service you do not have control over resources result in higher Bills |
| All the routing and domain configuration are managed | Poor traffic distribution - You cannot use load balancers, results in bottleneck at management of traffic spikes and latency problems. |
| New feature introduction every few months | Consistent changes needs consistent learning |
| Web-Based Analytics - AWS Amplify comes with a web-based analysis Dashboard for developers, designers, and project managers. | Bugs - As service is quite new it have lots off bugs |
| Multi programming language support - Javascript, React, Angular, Vue, Next, React, Flutter, Ionic, Android, iOS | Datastore uses Dynamodb - Dynamodb is very stiff and not suitable for every web application |
| Easy to Deploy - CI/CD pipeline can be setup to automate the deployment process |  |
